# Stable-Diffusion-X-Dreamhold
MTD Pro5, AI based visualization of textadventure

This project aims to use Stable Diffusion to visualize the text-adventure Dreamhold during live play.
As soon as the player enters a new location, the respective description is being used as a prompt to create an image and visualize the game environments.

*A high, arched space opens around you, deep within the earth. The floor is unevenly
interspersed with stalagmites and stone columns; your torchlight glitters in droplets from the
stalactites above. Between the pale, hanging pinnacles of frozen stone, a vein of dark ore
streaks the vault.
A narrow passage leads away to the south. A broader one enters on the west side; it once
crossed the cave, but the eastern exit has collapsed. A low crawl runs northeast. At one edge of
the cave, a pit descends abruptly. Wisps of steam rise from its depths.*
