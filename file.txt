You stand amid clutter, oddments, shelves and stacks. The chamber is comfortably broad, centered around a massive and well-worn wooden desk. But so much is jammed in, around the desk and up the panelled walls, that you barely find room to stand. Books; papers; dried plants; animals stuffed and preserved, antique instruments, candles of any hue. You don't recognize half of it, and you can't name half the rest.
